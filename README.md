# Introduction
`libfabbri` is a set of `C++` routines to calculate the scalar potential, 
magnetic induction field and the magnetic vector potential for uniformly 
magetised tetrahedra. The original papers by Massimo Fabbri [1,2] outline
the theory behind this code for uniformly magnetised [1] and linearly
magnetised [2] general polyhedra.
