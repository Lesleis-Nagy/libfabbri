Vectors and Matrices
====================

Basic vectors and matrices are implemented with the usual operations *e.g.*
addition, subtraction, cross, dot, and so forth. Two, three and four component
vectors are implemented along with two by two, three by three and four by four
component matrices. These objects are extensively used in subsequent parts of
this library.
